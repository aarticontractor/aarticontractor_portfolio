## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://aarticontractor.github.io/aarticontractor_portfolio/)

In this project, I have created a web application from scratch which displays my portfolio page.

It was made so that any recuiter can review samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position.

The portfolio displays About me, Work, Resume, and Contact sections for recruiters to reach out to me.

## Portfolio Highlights and Usage

<br>

When I load my portfolio, my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and my contact details are presented:

When I click on the resume section link, the UI scrolls to the resume section with my education and work experience:

When I click on the project link, the application's image is larger in size than the other showing a hover effect:

If I want to view the site on various devices with different sizes, I have a responsive layout that adapts to my screen size:

## Learning Points 

I learned the following skills while doing this project:


- Advanced properties of CSS (styling, display, text, flexbox,media query, variables etc) to make the page responsive.
- The Git flow (clone, add, commit, push, pull, etc)
- Made use of Google DevTools 
- Pseudo elements- for hovering effect, box sizing, and border styling
