## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://aarticontractor.github.io/aarticontractor_portfolio/)

In this project, I have created a web application from scratch.which displays my portfolio page

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 









## Table of Contents

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Portfolio Highlights and Usage


WHEN I load my portfolio, my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and my contact details are presented.

When I click on the work section link, the UI scrolls to the work section with titled images of my projects in GitHub.

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the other

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Learning Points 

I learned the following skills while doing this project:


- Advanced properties of CSS (styling, display, text, flexbox,media query, variables etc) to make the page responsive.
- The Git flow (clone, add, commit, push, pull, etc)
- Made use of Google DevTools 
- Pseudo elements- for hovering effect
